# 2019 FRC Competition Prep

This repository exists to track prep work for the 2019 competition.

We can use to track knowledge/skills/tasks that would be useful to acquire *before* the 2019 competition kicks off. It can also be used to document positive+negative experiences from the previous competition, with the hopes of avoiding the same mistakes. This is your chance to help next year's team 4682 be even better.

This will be useful for returning members of the programming team and for new members of the programming team.
