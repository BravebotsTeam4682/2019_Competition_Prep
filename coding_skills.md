# Programming skills

This is a curated list of programming skills that would be helpful to have acquired/acknowledged before the season even kicks off. Acquiring this knowledge beforehand will free you up during the season and help you accomplish more than if you hadn't.

This list is also a useful starting point for new programming team members who may or may not have any programming experience. They can use this list as a starting point to guide their individual research so that they feel more prepared to succeed once the season begins.

## General programming skills
* Version control (git + github)
  * Know how to make commits, merge branches, and resolve merge conflicts.
* Basic programming concepts (python or java, doesn't matter what you start with, we use both)
  * Declaring variables + primitive types
  * Primite data structures (arrays/lists, maps/dictionaries)
  * Iteration (while loops, for loops)
  * Object ooriented programming
    * Inheritance
    * Static classes/methods
* Linux
  * Basic terminal knowledge (cd, ls, mv, cp, etc...)
  *  Scheduling boot scripts + recurring programs with cron
        * Don't need to practice this, just know what it is and that it is a tool that is available to you (helpful for installing your co-processor computer vision scripts)
  * Installing dependencies with package managers (pip for python, apt-get for debian)
* Advanced programming concepts
  * Concurrency (multi-threading vs multi-processing)
  * OpenCV theory
    * You read up about computer vision techniques with OpenCV, maybe read a few tutorials to get familiar with it at a high level

## FRC specific programming skills

* Setting up a Windows dev environment for RoboRio (install IDE, WPILib, TalonSRX, etc...)
* Comprehending the WPILib architecture (Command based programming)
* Learn how to use motors + sensors with WPILib
* Learn about what PID loops are at a high level, and why they are helpful
