# Tasks

This is a wish list of tasks we could accomplish before FRC 2019 kickoff that would put the team in a better position to succeed

## Improve dev work environment

If we can clear out a corner of the room, install a Linux desktop machine, and mount a USB camera, that would be awesome for whoever is doing the computer vision work.

Whoever is doing the robo rio programming is kind of doomed to working in the hallway most of the time, but they should at least have a place to sit and place their laptop down while they work.

The current model of using laptops is not working. The laptops are slow and have very limited battery life. In the chaos of build season, the chargers often get lost. There aren't enough laptops to go around in the team, and team members often have to resort to using their personal cell phones to diagnose code problems and do technical research.

## Provide technical workshops for new members

If we have new members who don't have the necessary skills to succeed, we should consider employing workshops that the older teammates can run to hand off knowledge to the new team members. This isn't necessarily something we should do every year, but it will ocassionaly make sense to do.
